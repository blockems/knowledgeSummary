For example, and without limitation, NAB  or other NAB Group Company which \nhas received a  white-label license may directly process paym ents on behalf of a  third part y, for \nits customers or  other end users ( i.e. a service bureau type arrangement) under the brand or \nlabel of the third party or  under a white -label brand of NAB .  Whitelabelling Services do not \ninclude the performance by NAB or other NAB Group  Companies of Agency Clearing on behalf \nof third party institutions. It is not Whitelabelling Services simply because payme nts are \nprocessed by NAB (or other NAB Group Company) through a separate office.  If there is any \ndoubt about what is or is not a Whitelabelling Service, the parties should bear in mind  that \nconducting a Whitelabelling Service usually requires the set -up of a separate instance of the  \nsoftware, or through a separate \"office\" set up in the system.  \n(e) For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Agency Clearing \" means the performance of bulk \nclearing and gross settlement activities on behalf of third  party institutions. In perf orming Agency \nClearing, NAB does not validate or  authenticate any individual payments, and there are no \n\"value -adds\" to the processing of  payments. NAB  usually performs Agency Clearing on behalf \nof other banks, non -bank  financial institutions and credit unions but does not connec t to their \nsystem in doing so  (instead usually taking a file from them).  There will be no additional fees \npayable by NAB for Agency Clearing.  \n5 NOVATION  \n(a) A party may not assign its rights or novate or otherwise delegate its rights and obligations under \nthis Agreement, without the prior written consent of the other party, except that NAB may assign \nits rights or novate or otherwise delegate its obligations under this Agreement:  \n(i) to a Related Body Corporate o f NAB; or  \n(ii) to another supplier  to act as services manag er on behalf of NAB , subject to the \nFundtech IP Transfer Conditions .  \n(b) The Service Provider agrees to do all  acts necessary to give effect to clause 5(a) of this \nAppendix 15  including enter ing into appropriate a greement s required by NAB.   \n(c) The Service Provide r must not charge NAB or the Related Body Corpor ate of NAB a fee in \nrelation to the assignment, novation or delegation  of rights and obligations under this \nAgreement  to that Related Body Corporate . \n(d) The Service Provider may charge NAB a fee for the direct, reasonable and substantiated  costs \nincurred in relation to the novation of this Agreement to another supplier.  \n(e) Any attempted assignment, novation or delegation of all or any part of this Agreement that does \nnot comply with this Agreement is void.
